# Hey, I'm Trillium

<img src="./t5.svg" style="width: 100%" alt="Click to see the source" />

Thanks for taking a look at this test file, I'm trying to get it to work across Safari, Chrome, and Firefox and currently it does not. Ugh.

The svg contains media queries that change the border color. The intent of them is to reduce the text size as the SVG image gets rendered larger.

I planned on having light/dark media queries but that isn't working, so I plan on creating a dark/light picture src element instead.
