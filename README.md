# Hello World :)

Hi, Iâ€™m Trillium, I'm a fullstack web developer with experience in the React ecosystem, building projects with Nextjs and Gatsby. 
I enjoy getting into the knitty gritty of elusive bugs and errors, taking a larger scoped view to help design and architect applications and systems, or finding the exact right css to make a \<button\>Button\<\/button\> really shine.

I'm passionate about alternative coding methods, eg coding by voice ([Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/)!), coding without visual inputs, web accessibility, usability, and inclusion.

Actively looking for fantastic open source projects to contribute to, and Los Angeles or Remote based companies to work with.

Outside of software development work, I enjoy talking about entrepreneurship and business development, and using code to make mundane tasks simpler and more managable. 

I'm reachable at: Trillium@hatsfabulous.com or via my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/trilliumsmith/

## Projects

**Community Fridge Map** | [Repo](https://github.com/CollectiveFocus) | [Live Site](https://fridgefinder.app/)

A community fridge is a decentralized resource where businesses and individuals can donate perishable food. There are dozens of fridges hosted by volunteers across the country. Made with a team of skilled developers, project managers, UI designers, and UX researchers, this project is the crystallization of months of research and development. I have had the luxury of assisting in Front End Development, Dev Ops, and QA testing roles for this project.

**Kwdz.app** | [Repo](https://github.com/Spiteless/kwdz) | [Live Site](https://kwdz.app/)

Kwdz.app is a blogging productivity tool that counts the number of occurances of keywords within an article or blog post. The tool is simple, versatile, and lightwieght, utilizing query strings to store keywords themselves rather than hanging onto user data. This project was originally intended to be an inhouse tool with a very barebones version built, but was later adapted to be more user friendly. Usability features were added such as creating keyword groups, and adding a hotkey accessible command bar.
