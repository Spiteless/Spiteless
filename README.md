<h3 align="center">Fullstack Software Engineer and Web Developer based in Los Angeles, CA</h3>

I build robust, scalable web applications as well as fun one-offs and tiny tools. 
I enjoy getting into the knitty gritty of elusive bugs and errors, taking a larger scoped view to help design and architect systems, or finding the exact right css to make a website really shine.

Outside of software development work, I'm an avid social dancer, massage therapist, and espresso enthusiast.

I'm reachable at via email at: Trillium@trilliumsmith.com

As the lead developer of the Volunteer Resource Management System (VRMS), I oversee the strategic enhancement and modernization of this legacy application to align with contemporary application architecture standards. Constructed using Create React App for the frontend and an Express backend hosted on AWS, VRMS has undergone consistent refinement and growth since its inception in 2019. My responsibilities encompass delineating the technical direction, crafting software architecture, code composition and review, team management, and assuring the application's quality through rigorous testing measures.

Fridge Finder is a web app aggregating information on food donation fridges. Businesses and individuals can donate perishable food, allowing those of us who are food insecure to be able to get quality nourishment.
Made with a team of skilled developers, project managers, UI designers, and UX researchers, this project is the crystallization of months of research and development.
I've had the luxury of assisting in Front End Development, Dev Ops, and QA testing roles for this project.

Kwdz.app is a blogging productivity tool that counts the number of occurances of keywords within an article or blog post. The tool is simple, versatile, and lightwieght, utilizing query strings to store keywords themselves rather than hanging onto user data. This project was originally intended to be an inhouse tool with a very barebones version built, but was later adapted to be more user friendly. Usability features were added such as creating keyword groups, and adding a hotkey accessible command bar.

 <!-- * Utilized higher order functions to limit the execution of the application's most resource intensive tasks  -->
