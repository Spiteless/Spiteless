# Hello World :)

Hi, Iâ€™m Trillium, I'm a fullstack web developer with experience in the React ecosystem, building robust, scalable web applications as well as fun one-offs and tiny tools. 
I enjoy getting into the knitty gritty of elusive bugs and errors, taking a larger scoped view to help design and architect systems, or finding the exact right css to make a website really shine.

Outside of software development work, I'm an avid social dancer, massage therapist, and espresso enthusiast.

I'm reachable at via email at: Trillium@trilliumsmith.com
